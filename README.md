# Management Portal Web Application
> Created by: Lim Jie Wen

This is my submission for Arrivo's Part-time position to develop a Management Portal using Flutter web.

### Build Requirements:
1. Design Pattern/Architecture: Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
2. State Management: BLoC
3. UI Design: Material Design (Google)

### App Architecture
The app architecture follows the four main components of DDD, as laid out below.

``` 
    > lib
        > application
            > ...
        > domain
            > ...
        > infrastructure
            > ...
        > presentation
            > feature
                > widgets
                    > ...
            > feature.dart
